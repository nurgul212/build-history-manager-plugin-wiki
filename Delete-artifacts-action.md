This page presents example how to use [DeleteArtifacts](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-history-manager-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/pl/damianszczepanik/jenkins/buildhistorymanager/model/actions/DeleteArtifactsAction.java) action:

# Requirements
- at most two the most recent build should be saved
- for at most three more artifacts should be deleted
- all the rest must be deleted

# Configuration
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        buildDiscarder(

            BuildHistoryManager([
                [
                    continueAfterMatch: false,
                    matchAtMost: 2
                ],
                [
                    actions :
                        [DeleteArtifacts()],
                    continueAfterMatch: false,
                    matchAtMost : 3
                ],
                [
                    actions:
                        [DeleteBuild()],
                ]
            ])

        )
    }

    stages {
        stage('Demo') {
            steps {
                echo "Hello!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Example

Following presents build history before and after running above configuration. Numbers refer to build number.

| Before | After | Reason |
|-|-|-|
| <div align="center">[`23`]<br>with artifact</div> | <div align="center">[`23`]<br>with artifact</div> | Matched by first rule.<br>None action performed. |
| <div align="center">[`24`]<br>without artifact</div> | <div align="center">[`24`]<br>without artifact</div> | Matched by first rule.<br> None changes performed.<br>This is the last build matched by this rule because of `matchAtMost: 2` |
| <div align="center">[`25`]<br>with artifact</div> | <div align="center">[`25`]<br>without artifact</div> | Matched by second rule, artifact has been deleted |
| <div align="center">[`30`]<br>without artifact</div> | <div align="center">[`30`]<br>without artifact</div> | Matched by second rule.<br>Artifact should be removed but it is not published. |
| <div align="center">[`31`]<br>without artifact</div> | <div align="center">[`31`]<br>without artifact</div> | Matched by second rule.<br>Artifact should be removed but it was not present.<br>This is the last build matched by this rule because of `matchAtMost: 3` |
| <div align="center">[`32`]<br>with artifact</div> |  | Matched by second rule.<br>Build has been removed. |
